API v3:

- dotfield parameter is False by default. This means result's structure is full-depth dictionary by default.
  Eg. fields=refseq.rna parameter will generate the following structure: ["refseq"]["rna"] ...  by default
      if dotfield=true is also passed, then the following structure will be used: ["refseq.rna"]
- refseq version can now be queried: /query?q=NM_001798.4 and /query?q=NM_001798 will lead to the same result
- "exons" dict structure changed: now "exons" is a list of exons records, with "transcript" key containing the refseqID
  (refseqID was previously used as key). Inner "exons" key has also been renamed to "position"
- "ensembl", "refseq" and "accession", have a new inner key "translation" containing association between RNA
  and its corresponding protein.
- "reporter" source should be queried with "reporter:<some_string>" as some fields content in "reporter"
  are just integer and could be confused with gene ID
- fixed some discrepancy where an Ensemble gene ID could be associated to multiple Entrez gene ID. In such cases,
  matching symbol is used to find unique association.
