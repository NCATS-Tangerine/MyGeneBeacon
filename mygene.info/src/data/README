*ids.txt.xz files contain gene IDs used to create small indices/diff files.
The purpose is to provide demo data. Add or remove any IDs you want to be part
of the demo. A key "ids" pointing to one of these files should be added
in src_build_config document.

Also, ref_microbe_taxids.pyobj is a compressed pyobj pickled file containing
a list of microbes' taxonomy ids for which genome position should be queried.
This file should be copied in DATA_ARCHIVE_ROOT/entrez folder in order Entrez
datasource to be uploaded.
